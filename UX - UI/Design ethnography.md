##Design Ethnography

Design ethnography applies the concepts of anthropology and ehnography to the corporate world, especially in the field of design, marketing and production.

Patterns of every day's life are analyzed in the process of developing new product and services. Design ethnography must conduct anthropological studies then compile and present their findings in a way that make sense to the designers, product managers and engineers.

The goal is to make product that are relevant culturally and that can be part of the natural flow of every day's life. It bridges the separation of work and home lives but also the differences between different cultures and lifestyles.
